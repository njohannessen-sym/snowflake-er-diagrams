## DOT Scripts
The DOT folder contains DOT scripts that can interpreted by Graphviz software to generate diagrams. Copy and pasting the contents of these scripts into a Graphviz
application such as https://edotor.net/ to generate and download graph visualizations.

## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
The ERD folder contains ER diagrams as PNG files. These diagrams illustrate how tables in each schema are related by their columns.

## Table Relationship Document
ad-hoc-snowflake-table-relationships.csv contains realtionships between tables that were manually created. This file should be updated when a new relationship is discovered that was not automatically identified by the script.
